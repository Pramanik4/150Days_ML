- **Topic :-  Linear Regression with Multiple Variable**

  **Regression :-** Regression models are used to describe relationships between variables by fitting a line to the present data. Regression allows one to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.
  
  **Multiple Regression Model :-** Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. You can use multiple linear regression when you want to know:
 i) How strong the relationship is between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable (e.g. how rainfall, temperature).
 ii) The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variables (e.g. the expected yield of a crop at certain levels of rainfall, temperature).
 
  **Formula :-**

**Clustering** is the process of diving the dataset into groups, consisting of similar data points

    i) Points in the same group are as similar as possible 
    ii) Points in the different group are as disimilar as possible
    
**Examples of Clustering are :**

   i) Group of diners in a restaurant
   ii) Items are arranged in a mall
   

**K-Means is a clustering algorithm** who's main goal is to group similar elements or data points into a cluster

" K " in K-Means Clustering represent the number of cluster
Algorithm:
select the number of clusters to be identified eg:- select a value for k=3 in this case

**Algorithm**

  i) Randomly select 3 distinct data point

  ii) Measure the distance between the 1st point and selected 3 clusters

  iii) Assign the 1st point to the nearest cluster

  iv) Calculate the cluster mean using the new data point

  v) Repeat these steps again till all points get covered
